# IB-Game
During high school, I developed a 2D game simulating how the International Baccalaureate (IBDP) grading system works. The total score a student can achieve in IB is 45, with a minimum passing score of 24. In my game, the IB logo serves as the main object, controlled by the player using the keyboard's arrow keys. Boxes representing different subjects and components like "Theory of Knowledge" (TOK), "Extended Essay" (EE), and "Creativity, Activity, Service" (CAS) fall from the top of the screen. The player's goal is to catch these boxes with the IB logo.

Points are awarded as follows:

1.  1 point for each CAS, TOK, EE, and Internal Assessment (IA) component.
2.  2 points for each of the six main subjects, making the highest score 45.

The game ends when the player either:

1.  Reaches 45 points (maximum possible score).
2.  Misses a box and the score is below 24, resulting in a message saying, "Diploma not Awarded."
3.  If the score is above 24 and the player misses a box, the game shows "Diploma Awarded."
    The game demonstrates the dynamics of the IB grading system while maintaining a fun, interactive experience.
